## About the controls
- Cats always move into one direction until given the command to turn
- Check the key combinations for each cat in the scoreboard the top right corner
  - E.g. the first cat is always controlled by the LEFT and RIGHT arrow.
- Cats are given random commands until you give your first command (press one of the keys)
  - Once you have control over a cat an astronaut 🧑‍🚀 will appear in the bottom left corner of the cat

## About crashes
Try to avoid crashes with other cats, moving objects or obstacles, because it will slow you down!

## Multiplayer
- Depending on the selected level up to 9 players can play at one keyboard using the keys listed in the scoreboard
- Insider tip: if it gets to crowded just connect a second keyboard 😉

## Switching between keyboard and click mode
- The click mode can be activated by clicking anywhere (is activated by default on small screens)
- To go back to the keyboard mode, press space or any cat command key
- In the click mode: only the first cat can be controlled via the onscreen arrow buttons

## Creating custom levels
- Use the presets above the textarea to load a level into the text area
- Use the emoji buttons below the textarea to toggle cats or add more items
- Or just copy/type emojis into the textarea directly
- Use the number input to change the victory condition

## About the emojis
- Most of the used emojis are out of the very first emoji set
- But some bonus-level emojis are newer ones, depending on your installed set of emojis, they might not be displayed correctly
- The astronaut that marks human controlled cats is from Emoji 12.1 which was released 2019. If you have an older version you will see a person and rocket instead 🧑🚀
- You should still be able to play the game though independent of your emoji version (except if you have no emojis installed at all)
